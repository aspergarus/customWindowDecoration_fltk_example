Example of custom window decoration based on FLTK library
=========================================================

Basically to change window decoration, we need to make frameless window and then add borders and corners by ourself.

Besides we also need to add functionality to resize and move window. It can be done by capturing mouse coords, find the difference and move window, or change it size. 

The main issue here to create seamless image for borders, as we need to stretch borders by changing window size.

In fltk I didn't find the nice solution for this. Every time when I change window size it starts glitching(guess too many redrawings happened). 

Thus I made this example with static borders(can't change size), but user can move window by dragging top border.

Content is also just a static image. I didn't have time to make all widgets on the design, so pasted it as image.
